# Testing 

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate serves as a foundation and aims to provide a clear and consistent guide for building your WordPress plugins.

## Features

* The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API).
* Uses [PHPDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc) conventions to document the code.
* Example values are given, so you can see what needs to be changed.
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable.
* Note that this boilerplate includes a `.pot` as a starting translation file.
* Notes on managing assets prior to deployment are covered below
* Tools used for translation are below

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* This README, a ChangeLog, and a `gitignore` file.
* A subdirectory called `plugin-name` that represents the core plugin file.

## Installation

1. Copy the `plugin-name` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads *TODO*
4. Click on *Activate*

This will activate the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your plugin should behave while you're working with the Boilerplate.

## Recommended Tools

### Localization Tools

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the Boilerplate. To take advantage of this method,
there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to localize the plugin.

### GitHub Updater

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes native support for the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) which allows you to provide updates to your WordPress plugin from GitHub.

This uses a new tag in the plugin header:

>  `* GitHub Plugin URI: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`

Here's how to take advantage of this feature:

1. Install the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)
2. Replace `<owner>` with your username and `<repo>` with the repository of your plugin
3. Push commits to the master branch
4. Enjoy your plugin being updated in the WordPress dashboard

The current version of the GitHub Updater supports tags/branches - whichever has the highest number. It also supports different branches using the `GitHub Branch:` header. All that info is in [the project](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)

In future versions, there will be steps to specify branches or tags rather than the `master` branch.

## Important Notes

### Licensing

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is licensed under the GPL v2 or later; however, if you opt to use third-party code that is not compatible with v2, then you may need to switch to using code that is GPL v3 compatible.

For reference, [here's a discussion](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/2013/03/04/licensing-note-apache-and-gpl/) that covers the Apache 2.0 License used by [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

### Includes

Note that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:

1. `plugin-name/includes` is where shared functionality should be placed between `public` and `admin`
2. `plugin-name/admin/includes` is where dashboard-specific classes and dependencies should be placed
3. `plugin-name/public/includes` is where public-specific classes and dependencies should be placed

## Assets

The assets directory provides two files that are used to represent plugin header images.

When committing your work to the WordPress Plugin Repository, these files should reside in their own `assets` directory, not in the root of the plugin. The initial repository will contain three directories:

1. `branches`
2. `tags`
3. `trunk`

You'll need to add an `assets` directory into the root of the repository. So the final directory structure should include *four* directories:

1. `assets`
2. `branches`
3. `tags`
4. `trunk`

Next, copy the contents of the `assets` directory that are bundled with the Boilerplate into the root of the repository. This is how the WordPress Plugin Repository will retrieve the plugin header image.

Of course, you'll want to customize the header images from the place holders that are provided with the Boilerplate.

For more, in-depth information about this, read [this post](http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2012/09/13/last-december-we-added-header-images-to-the/) by [Otto](https://twitter.com/Otto42).

Plugin screenshots can be saved to one of two locations:

1. The old way is to keep them in the root of the plugin directory. This will increase the size of the download of the plugin, but make the images accessible for those who install it. This is deprecated in the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate
2. With the alternative way, you can save the screenshots in the `assets` directory, as well. The repository will look here for the screenshot files as well; however, they will not be included in the plugin download thus reducing the size of the plugin. As of its latest version, the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate now follows this convention.
