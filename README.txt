Displays the latest entry on Polaroid|Blipfoto by a given user in a widget.

[Polaroid|Blipfoto](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com/) is a photo journal service, allowing users to post one photo a day along with descriptive text and tags.

A limited number of extra photos are allowed to be uploaded, but this plugin does not interact with those.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
